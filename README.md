# Birth ðŸ‘¶

This repo includes a script `setup.sh` that automates setting up a fresh Ubuntu install with all my favorite software.

## Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:01100100/birth.git
bash setup.sh
```

Alternatively, copy the content of `setup.sh` and paste it into your terminal. This will avoid the need to first set up a ssh key to clone the repo.
